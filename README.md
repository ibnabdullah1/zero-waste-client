# Some Project features

- One of the best features of my website is that a user can donate his leftover food.

- If the user has any leftover food of his own, he can add it to the card. If he needs core food, he can send a food request.If the user wants to find a food then he can search by the name of the food in the search input field.

- If a user has attached a food card, he can go to My manage route and he can detail or update the food attached to his card. A user can see which food he is requesting to get. And there will be a status. If the status is available then the user can cancel the request. And if the request status is delivered then the request cannot be canceled.

- And user can sort based on expiration date of those feet that are available.Foods that expire early can be shown first. Foods that expire late can be shown first.

- The foods that have the highest quantity (top-6) are shown on the Home Page.

- If the user wants to add a food, see the details of a food, send a food request, then he must login. Without logging in, the user will not be able to do or see them. Because these routes have been protected routes.

- When he goes to manage foods route, he will only see the foods he has added. He will not be able to see the foods added by other users. It is verified with jwt.

- If a user added a Food, updates his added foods, if he requests for a food, if the user logs in etc. Then a success message is given with toast or Swal.
